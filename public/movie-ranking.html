<h1>Top 3 movies according to Sam</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies out of those I remember.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>

<p>This movie makes my top 3 list for multiple reasons: It has a great soundtrack, it's very nostalgic, and the story is engaging and intertaining.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings trilagy</h3>

<p>Listen I know it's not a single movie, but I had to include this series because it's just too hard to choose one movie from the series as the best.</p>
<p>The action and story is one of my personal favorites from any series so I had to include it on this list.</p>

<h3>White Christmas</h3>

<p>I had to include a christmas movie here for the sake of diversity lol.</p>
<p>It's a tradition to watch it with my family every year during the christmas season and it's got a funny story with fun characters.</p>
